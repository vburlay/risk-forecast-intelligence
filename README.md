# 🧠 Decision Intelligence Platform
### Operational Risk Forecasting and Decision-Support Prototype

---

## 📌 Overview

The Decision Intelligence Platform converts raw operational data into **structured decision intelligence** by detecting risks early, quantifying uncertainty, and evaluating the impact of potential interventions.

Unlike traditional dashboards that focus on retrospective analysis, the system:

* Detects deviations before they become critical
* Quantifies future risk and uncertainty
* Simulates system behavior under changing conditions
* Evaluates the effectiveness of corrective actions

👉 The goal is to enable **proactive decision-making under uncertainty**, rather than reactive monitoring.


---

## 🧠 Core Concept

The system transforms data into decisions through a structured analytical pipeline:

```
Observe → Predict → Detect → Assess → Simulate → Decide
```

Each stage increases the level of abstraction, turning raw data into actionable decision insights.

---

## ❗ Problem

Operational systems often react too late to emerging risks.

By the time deviations become visible:
- corrective actions are expensive  
- system stability is already compromised  
- decision-makers lack forward-looking insight  

This project addresses:
- delayed risk detection  
- lack of predictive indicators  
- absence of structured decision support  

---

## 🎯 Key Capabilities

### 📊 Monitoring (Operational Control)
- Real-time KPI tracking  
- Forecast vs actual comparison  
- Deviation analysis  
- Team-level risk overview  

---

### 📈 Forecast Analysis
- Time series modeling per team  
- Expected vs actual development  
- Trend-based deviation tracking  

---

### 🔎 Anomaly Detection
- Statistical deviation detection using rolling windows  
- Dynamic sensitivity control  
- Identification of unusual patterns  

**Formula:**
```
|score| = |(Actual - Trend) / Std|
```

---

### 🧬 Risk Assessment
- Gap-based risk scoring  
- Combined signal logic:
  - relative deviation (Gap)
  - anomaly intensity
  - temporal dynamics  

- Risk classification:
  - 🟢 Normal  
  - 🟡 Beobachten (Watch)  
  - 🔴 Kritisch (Critical)  

👉 The system approximates the probability of future risk events, providing a bridge between deterministic signals and probabilistic risk assessment.


---

### ⏳ Time-to-Risk Modeling

The system distinguishes between:

- **Zeit bis kritisch**  
  → deterministic estimate based on trend extrapolation  

- **Expected Time to Gap**  
  → probabilistic risk-based estimate  

👉 This separation enables both **explainability and forward-looking risk assessment**.

---

### 🧪 Simulation & Impact
- Combined workspace with two modes:
  - **Scenario** for what-if analysis
  - **Measure** for corrective actions

- Scenario controls:
  - volume increase  
  - trend acceleration  
  - volatility changes  

- Measure controls:
  - gap reduction  
  - stabilization  
  - forecast adjustment  

- Comparison vs baseline system behavior  
- Evaluation of **risk reduction effectiveness**  

👉 The system connects **prediction → action → outcome**.

---

### 🧭 Decision Support
- Rule-based workspace for action-oriented recommendations
- Compares available corrective actions against the current risk situation
- Explains the recommended action, expected KPI changes, alternatives, and confidence

👉 Decision Support translates simulation outputs into a concrete action recommendation.

---

## 🏗️ Architecture

The system follows a layered decision pipeline:

1. **Monitoring** – observe current system state  
2. **Forecast** – estimate expected behavior  
3. **Anomaly Detection** – detect deviations  
4. **Risk Assessment** – quantify future risk  
5. **Simulation & Impact** – model scenarios and evaluate corrective actions  
6. **Decision Support** – recommend actions and explain expected impact
